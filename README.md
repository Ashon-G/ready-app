# Ready App

This Expo project demonstrates a basic integration with Ready Player Me for creating and customizing a 3D avatar. The **Stash** screen contains the avatar creator so you can update your look and immediately see the results in the built-in GLB viewer.

Run the example tests with `npm test --silent`.
